She's polite and pleasant towards to her mistress Remilia Scarlet and those she's close with, such as Patchouli Knowledge, while being less formal with other people. With those she's frequently annoyed with, such as Marisa Kirisame, she can be somewhat harsh and direct with her insults and smack-talk, especially during duels. She seems to possess a wry wit and delivers comebacks stoically.</td>
